# LibGenMobile

The following outlines the easiest way to run the complete app ( as per the demo ):
1. Git clone this repo anywhere you want 

2. cd into the `LibGenMobile` directory 

3. Run the flask server: 
     - cd into server 
     - type `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 -p 3000` into the command line

4. Run the mobile application:
     - In a different terminal session, cd into mobile_app
     - type `flutter run`

5. App can now be used in a similar style to that of the demo
